This is another JavaScript experiment. Since JavaScript does not pass copies when doing assignments or sending variables to
functions, there can be unintended consequences. As a result, only primative data types should be used in assignment statements
unless you intend to simply make an alias for a complicated function call, rather than actually create a copy of a variable.

The current goal for this project is to create a 3D tetris game. As of writing this file, it is possible to instatiate a number 
of coloured cubes on the screen.
